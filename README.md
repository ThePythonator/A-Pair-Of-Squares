# A Pair Of Squares
A platformer with a twist - one set of controls for two characters!

### Controls
- **Arrow keys**: Moving characters, navigating menu
- **Space**: Jump, selecting items in menu

Pink always moves in the opposite direction to Blue, just to add to the challenge :)

### Tools
- Written in C++ using SDL.
- Aseprite used for artwork.
- LMMS used for music.
- [JFXR](https://jfxr.frozenfractal.com/) used for sound effects.
- Tiled used for level maps.
